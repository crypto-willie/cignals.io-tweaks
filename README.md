[cignals.io](https://cignals.io/) DOM & TAPE tweaks for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).

Did re-design for custom .css after months practicing learning order flow, especially DOM.  I left old DOM with Tape incase I ever decided to share.  I use Custom Scalp to trade.  It has everything I need on 1 screen. 

Not familar with OBS?  Google your friend!  DYOR! 

First time you open OBS you will need add your cignals log in & pass by clicking "Interact" on any "Browser" found under "Souce".   Close OBS and reopen!  

You can copy paste cignals links in OBS if you want to tweak anything.  Or edit URL.  Under "Properties"

BTC Screen except "BTC Scalp" runs in backgound.  Data will download as long as OBS open.  You can check or uncheck "Shutdown browser when not visible" under "Properties".

You can view "Source" by right click "Folder" and select "Windowed Projector (Source)" or "Fullscreen Projector (Source)".

Enjoy!
